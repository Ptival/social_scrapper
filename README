To run this you need Scrapy: http://scrapy.org/

For instance, to run the "Service Civique" spider and get the results in XML:

scrapy crawl service-civique.gouv.fr --set FEED_URI=output.xml --set \
FEED_FORMAT=xml

There is a lot of debug information on the standard error stream, use
2>/dev/null if needed.
